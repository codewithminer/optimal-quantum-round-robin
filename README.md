# optimal-quantum-round-robin

In the input.txt file:
the first line represents dl
The second line of our benchmark is based on one of the following:
1. waiting time
2. Response time
3. TurnAround time
Specifies the criterion with the first letter
In the following lines, the processes are specified
where the first number indicates the <arrival time> and the next numbers, respectively, the CPU burst time and IO burst time


In the output.txt file we have:
Calculate the five main criteria
1. Utilization
2. Throughput
3. TurnaroundTime
4. ResponseTime
5. WatingTime
according to the criteria specified with Ganchart
